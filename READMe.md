This is my magnum opus spotify data parsing project. To start I received all my listening history dating back to 2015 with Spotify.
They send them in very clunky JSON files with a lot of irrelevant information.
I used Python to clean the data and pick out just the song title, album, artist, genre and listening time.
From there I uploaded the cleaned CSV file to Tableau and made a data visualization dashboard.
I also used pandas and did some analysis that way as well.
